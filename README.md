# DiscordQuestPlaceholder
Complete Stream Quests on Discord without actually playing the games!
This is because of how they work, Discord judges a game by its name so
for example, if you rename an .exe to "genshinimpact.exe" Discord will
think that you're playing Genshin Impact, thus progressing the quest
without sacrificing 200GB on your drive for a badge
